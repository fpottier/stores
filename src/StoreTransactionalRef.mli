open Store

(**This module offers {b mutable stores based on mutable transactional
   references}. These stores support a simple form of transactions
   that can be either aborted or committed. Transactions cannot be
   nested. These stores do not support [copy]. *)

include STORE

(**[tentatively s f] runs the function [f] within a new transaction on the
   store [s]. If [f] raises an exception, then the transaction is aborted, and
   all updates performed by [f] on references in the store [s] are rolled
   back. If [f] terminates normally, then the updates performed by [f] are
   committed.

   Two transactions on a single store cannot be nested.

   A cell that is created during a transaction still exists after the
   transaction, even if the transaction is rolled back. In that case, its
   content should be considered undefined. *)
